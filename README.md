# docker-indy-node

A simple container setup to run a node in an Hyperledger Indy network.

## DEPRECATED!

The contents of this repository are deprecated. All work hier has been contributed to and is continued in https://github.com/IDunion/indy-node-container . If you are looking for a Containerized setup to run an Hyper Ledger Indy Node, please go there. üòâ

## How To

- `./generate_random_seeds.sh` and then securely backup `.node.env` which holds the seed for generating the private keys
- put `pool_transactions_genesis` and `domain_transactions_genesis` for your network into the `lib_indy` folder. The sub folder name has to match the `INDY_NETWORK_NAME` set in `.env` in the next step.
- set the variables (Networkname, ips, ports) in the `.env` file
- build and run the container in deamon mode `docker-compose up -d`
- check `docker logs docker-indy-node_indy-node_1` and `docker exec -it docker-indy-node_indy-node_1 validator-info` to check the state of your node
- you need to run indy_cli (no longer included here) to actually interact with the ledger


## Config

The relevant directories are mounted as

```
 volumes:
      - ./etc_indy:/etc/indy
      - ./lib_indy:/var/lib/indy
```

giving direct access to the relevant config files from the host machine, if needed. Note that the `NETWORK_NAME` is overriden at startup with the value from `INDY_NETWORK_NAME` from `.env`.
